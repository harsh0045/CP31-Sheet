## CP31 Sheet Solutions
The **CP31 Sheet** consists of **31 problems for each difficulty rating** on Codeforces, starting from **800 to 1600**. This means that there are 31 problems rated 800, 31 problems rated 900, and so on, up to 1600.
The sheet covers a wide range of algorithmic challenges, helping to enhance problem-solving skills progressively as you move through the different difficulty levels. 
The aim is to develop a strong foundation in competitive programming by solving problems of increasing complexity. And a very big Thanks to the team TLE ELIMINATOR for providing such valuable CP sheet to us.
